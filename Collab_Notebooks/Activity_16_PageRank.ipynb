Task: For the network shown below, calculate the PageRank of the pages A, B, and C, and D by writing a Python program to iteratively obtain the final page ranks. Assume that the damping parameter d is 0.7. Please follow the solution structure provided in the code block below."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"GWLVagacmrXn"},"source":["\n","\n","```\n","# Step1.
